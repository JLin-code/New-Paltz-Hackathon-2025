# Laundry Tracker - New Paltz Hackathon 2025

## What is this?

A real-time laundry machine availability tracker for college residence halls. Students can check which washers and dryers are available before walking to the laundry room.

## The Problem

Students waste time walking to laundry rooms only to find all machines occupied. There's no way to know machine availability without physically checking.

## Our Solution

A web app that shows:
- 🏢 **All residence halls** on campus
- 🧺 **Machine status** (available, in-use, out-of-order)
- ⏱️ **Time remaining** on machines currently in use
- 📱 **Real-time updates** so you always have current information

## How It Works

1. Select your residence hall
2. View all washers and dryers
3. See which machines are available
4. Check how long until occupied machines are free

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:** Vue.js + Bulma CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express  
**Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
